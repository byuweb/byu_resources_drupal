# BYU Resources

This module gets information about BYU's web components and drupal modules and displays them in a view using the BYU feature card component. It then updates the information on these resources with cron.

**Note**: When you install the module, it can take up to five minutes to finish installing. This is because when you are installing the module, it pulls all the information on the resources we have, and saves each of them as their own BYU resource node.

This is an update.
